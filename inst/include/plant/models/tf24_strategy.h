  // Scientific version. Bump ONLY when equations or default parameters change
  // the simulation output for identical inputs. Do NOT bump for refactors,
  // performance, interface, or serialisation changes. Bumping invalidates
  // logpile's cache for this model (see plant::model_version() / model_id()).
  // Starts at 2: a published result exists using pre-versioning "v1" science.
  // v3 (#517/#554): NSC storage pool + reserve-gated growth and reserves-based
  // mortality change the simulation output for identical inputs; TF24f's
  // compound version auto-tracks this to 3.1.
  // v4: the hydraulic shut-down exits no longer leave the previous step's
  // transport state in place, so a shut-down plant stops drawing water from the
  // soil (it used to keep extracting its last wet-step uptake, because `Leaf`
  // is reused across steps and soil_consumption_ feeds the patch water
  // balance). Water-limited runs therefore change: on the scenario gateway,
  // offspring production moves by up to 5e-3 relative on 5 of 8 scenarios,
  // while every success/failure classification is unchanged. TF24f's compound
  // version auto-tracks this to 4.1.
  // v5: the leaf gas-exchange and hydraulics model is now the standalone
  // `phylloptim` package rather than a copy in this repo, and the swap carries four science
  // changes. Measured on the one-species SCM scenario of test-strategy-tf24.R
  // (max_patch_lifetime = 5), offspring production moves 81.9083 -> 83.9026,
  // i.e. **+2.4%**. Attributed by re-running both arms with the atm_kpa driver
  // forced to 101.3, which removes the pressure change and leaves the rest:
  //
  //     arm                  atm_kpa 100.5     atm_kpa 101.3
  //     this repo's leaf        81.9083           81.8201
  //     the leaf package        83.9026           81.8985
  //
  // So **the pressure fix is ~25x the rest of the swap put together** (+2.4%
  // against +0.10%), which was not the expectation going in. The leaf package's
  // ppm-to-Pa conversion is derived from atm_kpa (phylloptim #15 item 10c) instead
  // of hard-coded at 0.1013 = 1e-6 * 101300 Pa; TF24_Environment's atm_kpa driver
  // defaults to **100.5**, so Gamma*, Kc, Ko, Km and the ci root-find bounds all
  // move. Before the fix the conductance side of the model responded to atm_kpa
  // while the photosynthesis side silently assumed sea level -- visible in the
  // table as this repo's leaf moving only -0.11% across the same 0.8 kPa that
  // moves the package -2.4%.
  //
  // The remaining +0.10% is the two further stale-state exits (phylloptim #26,
  // ported from #585) plus the supply-path extraction (phylloptim #2). TF24f's
  // compound version auto-tracks this to 5.1.
  // v6: the leaf package moved to ONE representation for water potential --
  // positive magnitudes throughout (phylloptim #25). Two consequences, and the first
  // is why this is a version bump rather than a refactor:
  //   * the **`opt_root_psi` aux changes sign**. It is now the positive magnitude,
  //     which is what TF24f's `opt_root_psi_state` has always held. Before, the aux
  //     reported the signed potential while tf24f_strategy.cpp negated it back for
  //     the state -- an inconsistency in plant's own reported outputs, and the two
  //     compensating negations are deleted here. Any stored output or cached
  //     analysis reading that aux would silently change meaning, which is exactly
  //     what model_version() exists to catch.
  //   * outputs move slightly: one-species SCM offspring production 83.9026 ->
  //     83.8761, i.e. **-3.2e-4 relative**. This is NOT an equation change. The
  //     rewrite is exactly sign-symmetric in IEEE; what is not is boost's TOMS748,
  //     whose iterates depend on the bracket's orientation, and #25 reverses it.
  //     Measured there: 12 of 288 golden operating points differ by 1-3 ULP, the
  //     rest exactly. The SCM's adaptive stepper and node schedule amplify that to
  //     3e-4 -- within the ~GSS_tol_abs (1e-3) ceiling the leaf package documents,
  //     and small enough that every pinned test value and the exact stochastic
  //     TF24 counts (101/23) pass unchanged.
  // TF24f's compound version auto-tracks this to 6.1.
  // v7: the collar bracket is finally clamped to root_psi_crit, the potential at
  // which root conductivity is down to 5% (phylloptim #24, plant #584). The clamp was
  // written as a std::max against a *signed* root_psi_crit, so it could never bind
  // and the solver optimised over a collar the root system cannot supply. **The
  // window is 1.2 MPa wide at TF24's defaults** -- psi_crit = 7.085493 against
  // root_psi_crit = 5.870283 -- so this is a dry-corner correction, not a rounding
  // one. Two regimes inside it: the interval is tightened (the plant still
  // transpires, at a wetter collar), or root_psi_crit lands below the zero-uptake
  // collar and the plant shuts down because no operating point both moves water and
  // stays inside the root limit.
  //
  // No tested scenario moves: the standard SCM run stays at 83.8761 offspring, bit
  // for bit, because a mesic patch never drives the collar past 5.87 MPa. It is
  // still a version bump -- a user running a dry scenario gets different (correct)
  // numbers for identical inputs, and logpile's cache has to know.
  // TF24f's compound version auto-tracks this to 7.1.
  // v8: `TF24_Environment`'s `atm_kpa` driver default goes **100.5 -> 101.3**, and
  // this is the entry to read if you only read one. It largely CANCELS v5.
  //
  // v5 recorded +2.4% from deriving the leaf's ppm -> Pa conversion from `atm_kpa`
  // instead of hard-coding 0.1013. That constant *was* 101.3 kPa in disguise
  // (1e-6 * 101300 Pa), so the shift was not the fix doing damage -- it was this
  // driver disagreeing with the rest of the model. 100.5 arrived in `34d46ac2`
  // ("Simplify scm & environment interface", #446), an interface refactor that does
  // not mention atmospheric pressure, with no rationale recorded anywhere, while
  // every leaf-level test used 101.3. An artefact, not a site elevation.
  //
  // Pinning it to the value the model already assumed collapses the whole branch's
  // movement. Net effect of ALL of it (the swap, the #15 catch-up, the #26 ported
  // fixes, #25 and #24) against `develop`:
  //
  //     one-species SCM offspring   81.9083 -> 81.7426     -0.20%
  //     stochastic TF24 counts      103 / 28 -> 103 / 28   unchanged, exactly
  //
  // So **+2.43% became -0.20%**, and every pinned baseline reverts to develop's own
  // values: the two SCM offspring figures pass at their original 82.09077702 /
  // 67.54060383, and the seeded stochastic integers match bit for bit. That exact
  // match on discrete counts is a sharper statement than any tolerance-based check
  // that the swap preserves TF24's science.
  //
  // The fix itself is NOT undone -- an off-sea-level run still gets a self-consistent
  // Gamma*/Kc/Ko/Km and conductance side, which is the whole point of item 10c. Set
  // `atm_kpa` per site if you mean altitude; it just no longer defaults to an
