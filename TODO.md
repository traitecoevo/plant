# Next Step

test- Cohort --> different lengths in tests, ode

# TODO 

Align names state_names in strategy, ode_names in plant and higher, internals, state, also ode_state in plant (iterator)

Access state_names  within strategy from R; not working when exposing via RcppR6_classes.yml

Reinstate plantplus as new strategy

- enable access to derived variables
- add back in tests in reference comparison, those using variables not in basic model are comment out for now


Plant

-  plant$internals$states same as plant$ode_state??
