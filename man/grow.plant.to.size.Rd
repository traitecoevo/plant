\title{Grow Plant To Given Size}
\usage{
grow.plant.to.size(plant, env, distance.from.target, max.time = 1000)
}
\arguments{
  \item{plant}{A \code{Plant} object.}

  \item{env}{An \code{Environment} object.}

  \item{distance.from.target}{A function that takes
  \code{plant} as its only argument and computes the
  distance from a target.  The function must return
  negative values when the plant is smaller than the
  target.  See Details.}

  \item{max.time}{Time to run the ODE out for -- only
  exists to prevent an infinite loop (say, on an
  unreachable size).}
}
\value{
A plant grown to the appropriate size.  This is a
\emph{copy} of the input plant.
}
\description{
Grow a plant up to a certain size from a seed.
}
\details{
This is a little utility and is likely to fail.

To stop at a height of 10, the \code{distance.from.target}
function should be \code{function(plant) plant$height -
10}, so that the return value is negative when the plant is
smaller than the target size.
