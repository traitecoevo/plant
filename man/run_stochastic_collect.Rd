\usage{
run_stochastic_collect(p, random_schedule = TRUE)
}

\item{p}{A \code{\link{FF16_Parameters}} object}

\item{random_schedule}{setting to TRUE causes algorithm to generate
a random schedule based on seed rain and area.}

\description{
Run a stochastic simulation of a patch, given a Parameters
}
\details{
This one might need to be made differently so that different
schedules can be added easily.
Not sure if this is how we will generally want to do this.
