\title{Generate Default Cohort Introduction Times}
\usage{
cohort_schedule_times_default(max_time)
}
\arguments{
\item{max_time}{Time to generate introduction times up to (the
last introduction time will be at least \code{max_time}).}
}
\value{
Vector of introduction times.
}
\description{
Generate a suitable set of default cohort introduction times,
biased so that introductions are more closely packed at the
beginning of time, become increasingly spread out.
}
\details{
The reason for the stepped distribution is to keep step sizes as
series of doublings.  Doing this limits the range of possible
introduction times from an infinite set of possible values to a
very limited subset of values (based on combinations of 1, 0.5,
0.25, 0.125 etc).  The reason for doing this is to minimise the
number of unique introduction times across all species. The ODE
stepper needs to stop at each point where a cohort is introduced.
If each species was selecting a bunch of points that was
essentially unique (compared to those selected for all other
species), the number of unique cohort introductions times could
get very large, requiring more ODE steps.
