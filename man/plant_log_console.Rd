\description{
Activate logging with loggr
}
\details{
By default plant prints little information about its progress.
This can be modified by enabling logging.  A formatter that is
different to the default \code{loggr::log_file} formatter is
selected here; it will print additional information that plant's
internal logging functions record.

"Schedule" events (splitting) are sent to the DEBUG stream,
everything else is sent to INFO.  All events have a "routine"
field added to them, which is useful if sent to a Redis server
(using \code{loggr.redis}).
