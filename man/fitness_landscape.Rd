\title{Fitness Landscape}
\usage{
fitness_landscape(
  trait_matrix,
  p,
  hyperpar = param_hyperpar(p),
  log_fitness = TRUE,
  ctrl = scm_base_control()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{trait_matrix}{A matrix of traits corresponding to mutants to
introduce into the light environment constructed by the residents
in \code{p}.}

\item{p}{Parameters object.  Needs to contain residents with their
incoming seed rain.}

\item{hyperpar}{Hyperparameter function to use. By default links
to standard function for this strategy type.}

\item{log_fitness}{Logical; if \code{TRUE} report per capita
seed rain rather than fitness.}

\item{ctrl}{A plant control object}
}
\value{
Vector with the output seed rain.  Mutants have an
arbitrary seed rain of one, so this is the rate of seed
production per capita.
