\usage{
fitness_landscape(trait_matrix, p, raw_seed_rain = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{trait_matrix}{A matrix of traits corresponding to mutants to
introduce into the light environment constructed by the residents
in \code{p}.}

\item{p}{Parameters object.  Needs to contain residents with their
incoming seed rain.}

\item{raw_seed_rain}{Logical; if \code{TRUE} report per capita
seed rain rather than fitness.}
}
\value{
Vector with the output seed rain.  Mutants have an
arbitrary seed rain of one, so this is the rate of seed
production per capita.
}
