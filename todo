TODO

test conversino of weibull_density(max_patch_lifetime) and mean_interval
test numerical integration of weibull_disturbance.density ~= 1
numerical integration of no_disturbance.density = time


# init size disturbance

- scm api design
- solve_patch()

maybe -
- construct_patch()

- how does cohort introductino sechedule works
 take ansize distribution and chop into bits
 loop repeatedly to calculate error
